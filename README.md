OLA CinderBlock is designed for use with the open-source C++ library Cinder: http://libcinder.org

Tested on Cinder release 0.8.5+ and glNext branch: https://github.com/cinder/Cinder/tree/glNext
MacOSX only.

Note: I created this project as an exercise in creating Cinder Blocks, and because I've found it useful to wrap OLA as a C++ client in my own work.  I am not affiliated with the Open Lighting Project.  This software is distributed as-is.  If you have any suggestions for improvements, please open an Issue.

OLA 0.9.3.
